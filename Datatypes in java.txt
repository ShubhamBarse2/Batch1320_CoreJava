 
Data Types in java :

Data types define what kind of data a variable can store in Java.
Java is a strongly typed language, which means you must declare the data type before using any variable.

Example:
int age = 25;



Types of Data Types in Java : 

Java data types are divided into two major categories:

A. Primitive Data Types
B. Non-Primitive Data Types



A. Primitive Data Types : 
(8 data types provided by Java)

 
(Integer)
1. byte 
2. short 
3. int 
4. long 


(Points Values)
5. float 
6. double

7. char 
8. boolean  




for Primitive DataTypes : 

Example : 



package com.jbk;

public class Student {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		byte age = 23;
		short seatNumber = 23346;
		int pinCode = 23456784;
		long adharNo = 232345678908634l;

		float height = 6.5f;
		double marks = 99.99;

		boolean checkPassed = true;

		char specialSymbol = '@';

		System.out.println("Student Age is =  " + age);
		System.out.println("Student Seat No is =  " + seatNumber);
		System.out.println("Student Pincode is =  " + pinCode);
		System.out.println("Student adharNo is =  " + adharNo);
		System.out.println("Student height is =  " + height);
		System.out.println("Student marks is =  " + marks);
		System.out.println("Student Pass/Fail is =  " + checkPassed);
		System.out.println("Student specialSymbol is =  " + specialSymbol);

	}

}
