Types of Variables in Java


 1> Local Variable
Declared inside a method

Must be initialized before use

void show() {
    int x = 10;
}


2> Instance Variable (Global Variable)

Declared inside class but outside methods
Object-level variable

class Student {
    int rollNo;
}


Variable Initialization

int a;      // declaration
a = 10;     // initialization


int a = 10; // declaration + initialization



Why Variables Are Needed?

To store data
To reuse values
To perform operations
To make programs dynamic





Create 5 classes with meaningful name : 
in each class contains 7 variables with proper naming Conventions 
display using message
